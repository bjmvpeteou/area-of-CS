        <h1>Information Technology (IT)</h1>
        <img class="image1" src="https://i.goopics.net/txk45f.jpg">
        <p><strong>Information technology is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve, and exchange all kinds of electronic data and information. IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies. IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology (ICT). An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system — including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group of IT users.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>IT is a branch of <a href="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Website\What is computer science\index.html" alt="Computer Science"> Computer Science</a> but it also cover many areas such as:</strong></p>

                    The field of networking and communication includes the analysis, design, implementation, and use of local, wide-area, and mobile networks that link computers together. The Internet itself is a network that makes it feasible for nearly all computers in the world to communicate.
                    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#:~:text=A%20computer%20network%20is%20a%20set%20of%20computers,over%20digital%20interconnections%20to%20communicate%20with%20each%20other." alt="computer network"> computer network</a> links computers together via a combination of infrared light signals, radio wave transmissions, telephone lines, television cables, and satellite links. The challenge for computer scientists has been to develop protocols (standardized rules for the format and exchange of messages) that allow processes running on host computers to interpret the signals they receive and to engage in meaningful “conversations” in order to accomplish tasks on behalf of users. Network protocols also include flow control, which keeps a data sender from swamping a receiver with messages that it has no time to process or space to store, and error control, which involves transmission error detection and automatic resending of messages to correct such errors. (For some of the technical details of error detection and correction, see information theory.)</p>

                    Data storage is the recording (storing) of information ( data) in a storage medium. Handwriting, phonographic recording, magnetic tape, and optical discs are all examples of storage media, some authors even propose that DNA is a natural data storage mechanism. Recording may be accomplished with virtually any form of energy.
                    <p>Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC</p>

                    <img class="image4" src="https://i.goopics.net/b6dtq9.jpg">
                    Information management (IM) is primarily concerned with the capture, digitization, representation, organization, transformation, and presentation of information. Because a computer’s main memory provides only temporary storage, computers are equipped with auxiliary disk storage devices that permanently store data. These devices are characterized by having much higher capacity than main memory but slower read/write (access) speed. Data stored on a disk must be read into main memory before it can be processed. A major goal of IM systems, therefore, is to develop efficient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" alt="algorithms"> algorithms</a> to store and retrieve specific data for processing.
                    <p>IM systems comprise databases and algorithms for the efficient storage, retrieval, updating, and deleting of specific items in the database. The underlying structure of a database is a set of files residing permanently on a disk storage device. Each file can be further broken down into a series of records, which contains individual data items, or fields. Each field gives the value of some property (or attribute) of the entity represented by a record. For example, a personnel file may contain a series of records, one for each individual in the organization, and each record would contain fields that contain that person’s name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and so forth...</p>

                <p>
                   <em class="em1">Hardware and software are mutually dependent on each other. Both of them must work together to make a computer produce a useful output. Software cannot be utilized without supporting hardware and Hardware without a set of programs to operate upon cannot be utilized and is useless.</em>
                    <h3>Hardware</h3>
                        <p>
                            Hardware represents the physical and tangible components of a computer, i.e. the components that can be seen and touched.
                            <p>Computer hardware are mouse, keyboard, etc (Input devices); printer, monitor, etc (Output devices); hard disk, CD, DVD, etc (Secondary storage devices); CPU, motherboard, RAM, etc (Internal components).</p>

                            Computer software is programming code executed on a computer processor. The code can be machine-level code, or code written for an operating system. To put it simply, software is anything that tells hardware what to do and how to do it, including computer programs and apps on your phone. Video games, photo editors, and web browsers are just a few examples.
                            <p>An operating system is software intended to provide a predictable and dependable layer for other programmers to build other software on, which are known as applications.Computer software provides a dependable layer for hardware manufacturers. This standardization creates an efficient environment for programmers to create smaller programs, which can be run by millions of computers.</p>

                Software engineering is the discipline concerned with the application of theory, knowledge, and practice to building reliable software systems that satisfy the computing requirements of customers and users. It is applicable to small-, medium-, and large-scale computing systems and organizations. Software engineering uses engineering methods, processes, techniques, and measurements. Software development, whether done by an individual or a team, requires choosing the most appropriate tools, methods, and approaches for a given environment.
                <p>Software is becoming an ever larger part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#:~:text=A%20computer%20system%20is%20a%20%22complete%22%20computer%20that,such%20as%20a%20computer%20network%20or%20computer%20cluster." alt="computer system"> computer system</a> and has become complicated to develop, often requiring teams of programmers and years of effort. Thus, the development of a large piece of software can be viewed as an engineering task to be approached with care and attention to cost, reliability, and maintainability of the final product. The software engineering process is usually described as consisting of several phases, called a life cycle, variously defined but generally consisting of requirements development, analysis and specification, design, construction, validation, deployment, operation, and maintenance.</p>

        <h1>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1>
        <img class="image11" src="https://i.goopics.net/jwn4xy.jpg">
        <p><strong>While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) have surfaced over the last few decades, John McCarthy offers the following definition in his 2004 paper, " It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable."</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Artificial intelligence is an area of research that goes back to the very beginnings of computer science. The idea of building a machine that can perform tasks perceived as requiring human intelligence is an attractive one. The tasks that have been studied from this point of view include <em>Robotics</em>, <em>Automation</em>, game playing, language translation, natural language understanding, fault diagnosis, and supplying expert advice.</strong></p>

                <img class="image12" src="https://i.goopics.net/3dbqqj.png">
                Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of computer science and engineering. Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans. Robotics integrates fields of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering" alt="mechanical engineering"> mechanical engineering</a>, electrical engineering, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_engineering_(field)" alt="information engineering"> information engineering</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechatronics" alt="mechatronics"> mechatronics</a>, electronics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioengineering" alt="bioengineering"> bioengineering</a>, computer engineering, <strong><em>control engineering</em></strong>, software engineering, mathematics, etc.
                <p>Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in many situations for many purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including inspection of radioactive materials, bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g. in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and radiation). Robots can take on any form, but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is claimed to help in the acceptance of robots in certain replicative behaviors which are usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other human activity. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.</p>

The discipline of controls overlaps and is usually taught along with electrical engineering and mechanical engineering at many institutions around the world.
                <p>The practice uses sensors and detectors to measure the output performance of the process being controlled; these measurements are used to provide corrective feedback helping to achieve the desired performance. Systems designed to perform without requiring human input are called automatic control systems (such as cruise control for regulating the speed of a car).

        <p class="Conclusion">Computer science is a very vast field. There are uncountable domains... All areas of computer science are important and some are particularly so. While these fields have the potential to do great good in the world, they also come with risks. Nevertheless, there is hope that the benefits will outweigh the unintended consequences and that humanity ability to work their way through their problems will continue to change the world and lead us toward a better future.</p>
